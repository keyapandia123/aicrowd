The precision (proportion of recommended movies that are relevant) was around 83-86% for the models, the recall (proportion of relevant movies that are recommended) was also in the same ballpark. Thus, for all the models, recommended movies were predominantly relevant and relevant movies were generally recommended. \n","- We also compared the predicted and actual user-item ratings for two user-item pairs: one with a known (true) or measured value and one without a known (true) or measured value. \n","- The true prediction of user A3LDPF5FMB782Z for item 1400501466 was measured (5.0). The estimated rating of the item-item tuned model (4.71) for this user-item pair wwas the closest to the actual rating of this user-item pair.  The predicted rating from the matrix based tuned model (4.13) was closer to the actual rating than the estimated rating of the matrix based baseline model (4.08). But the ratings of the user-user tuned CF model (4.29), the item-item baseline model (4.27), and the item-item tuned model (4.71) for this user-item pair were even closer to the actual rating of this user-item pair than the estimated rating of the matrix based tuned model (4.13). \n","- The predicted rating of user A34BZM6S9L7QI4 for item 1400501466 was unknown. The various models predicted different ratings for this user-item pair.  For example, the matrix based baseline model estimated this rating to be 4.40, whereas the matrix based tuned model estimated this rating to be 4.22. The item-item tuned model predicted this rating as 4.29 and the user-user tuned model predicted this rating as 4.29 as well. \n","- We were also able to predict top 'n' recommendations for individual users based on each of the models and were able to find similar (neighboring) users based on the user-user and item-item CF model algorithms.
